### Shell Scripts:
csye6225-aws-networking-setup.sh to create and configure required networking resources using AWS CLI
csye6225-aws-networking-teardown.sh to delete networking resources using AWS CLI

Running Shell script through terminal

chmod +x csye6225-aws-networking-setup.sh --> to give execute rights

./csye6225-aws-networking-setup.sh --> to run the file
